        <p>Hey! This is me <strong>Amirmahdi Salmanzade</strong>, i know what are you thinking about: Shet man what a long name!
            In that case i should say it wasn't my option so don't take it serious,
            anyway <strong>i am a 20 year old boy</strong> and the reson of making this page it's not for talking about myself only,
            i am not a freak or something like that, this is a basic <em>HTML and CSS</em> corse project to just practice what i've learned so far.
